<h1>Exploring Bengaluru</h1>

<p>The City's history dates back to around 890 AD, in a stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore. The Begur inscription is written in Halegannada (ancient Kannada), mentions 'Bengaluru Kalaga' (battle of Bengaluru). It was a significant turning point in the history of Bangalore as it bears the earliest reference to the name 'Bengaluru'.</p>
<p>Bengaluru is sometimes referred to as the "Silicon Valley of India" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter.

<center><h2>Famous eateries in Bengaluru</h2></center>
<ol>
	<li><b>Benne Masala Dosa</b></li>
	<p>There is reason that this sits at the No.1 position on this list. And to understand that reason, it is imperative that you pay CTR a visit. This is hands-down, the best dosa I have eaten in my life, and I know many food lovers and experts who feel the same. Not the Tamil-style thin dosa that you may be used to, the dosa here is typically Kannadiga. Fluffy on the inside, it is cooked with plenty of butter (benne) to make sure it has a golden crunchy layer. Also, this is served only with chutney and not with sambhar, another anomaly. Go early and be prepared to share your table with others, as the crowds never abate</p>

	<li><b>Mysore Pak</b></li>
	<p>
Well not really Bangalore’s claim to fame but there’s a slim chance you’ll make your way to Mysore, thus you may as well try the ever-famous Mysore Pak while visiting Bangalore. Get some packed up and take it for friends and family back home too. Anand Sweets and Gundappa Sweets both do good versions.</p>
